/**
 *  The RS class listens for incoming HTTP requests on a given port,
 *  then passes each one to a "handler" capable of generating an HTTP response
 *  for it, which is then sent back to the client.
 *
 *  RS instances can be created and used from any thread but it's
 *  recommended to have the main thread's runloop be running so internal callbacks
 *  can be handled e.g. for Bonjour registration.
 *
 *  See the README.md file for more information about the architecture of RS.
